A documentation file can be found in the root of the sectorfile. This PDF will explain and guide you on installting this controller pack so it works perfectly. However a few things are required:

* Euroscope 3.2 https://www.euroscope.hu/
* Euroscope Beta *Required* to see rotated Ground Views (http://euroscope.hu/installbeta/changes.html)

Compatible with the Euroscope radar client only. Not tested with VRC so it may or may not work with VRC.
